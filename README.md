Problem Statement:
A diamond distributor has recently decided to exit the market and has put up a set of 3,000 diamonds for auction. Seeing this as a great opportunity to expand its inventory, a jewelry company has shown interest in making a bid. To decide how much to bid, you will use a large database of diamond prices to build a model to predict the price of a diamond based on its attributes. Then you will use the results of that model to make a recommendation for how much the company should bid.

The diamond price that the model predicts represents the final retail price the consumer will pay. The company generally purchases diamonds from distributors at 70% of that price, so your recommended bid price should represent that.
